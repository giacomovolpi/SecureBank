# SecureBank
Project for the Foundations of Cybersecurity course, developed in C++ with the OpenSSL library. The purpose of this project was to create a secure communication channel, in particular:
- The authentication protocol must fulfill Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- Client-server communication must fulfill confidentiality, integrity, no-replay and non-malleability
- Password and history of transfers of any given user cannot be stored in the clear.

Note that secure coding was not the main objective of the project.
